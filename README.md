# Gapminder-World-data-analysis
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live heir lives in different countries, racked across the years, and on a umber of different indicators. For this project I selected child mortality, income, life expectancy, and population indicators.  I am going to clean and merge these indicators into one DataFrame then going deep analyzing It tracking the relations between different indicators trying to get insights to make decisions that should make our life better.

I answered the next questions:

  Have certain regions of the world been growing in selected indicators better than others?

  Is child mortality related to any other indicators?

  Is life expectancy child mortality related to any other indicators?

  Is Income related to population?

To conclude the next outcomes:

  Qatar has the highest mean income level, Norway has the highest mean life expectancy level, China has the highest population mean levels, and Monaco has the least number of child mortalities below age 5 per 1.000 births.

  An increase in income decreases child mortality, but an increase in population has no strong effect on it.

  An increase in income increases life expectancy, but an increase in population has no strong effect on it.

  An increase in population has an inverse effect on income.

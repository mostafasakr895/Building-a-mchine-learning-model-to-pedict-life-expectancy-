# Gapminder World (Building a mchine learning model to pedict life expectancy)
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live heir lives in different countries, racked across the years, and on a umber of different indicators. For this project I selected child mortality, income, life expectancy, and population indicators. I am going to clean and merge these indicators into one DataFrame then build a mahine learning model to predict life expectancy. 

After training more than a regression model, random forest had the lowest rmse, and child_mortality is the feature that has the mose effect on life expectancy. It is recommended use that model in predictions.
